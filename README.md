#JAVA BYTE CODE
Java bytecode is a form of machine language instructions. However, it is not primitive to the CPU. Java bytecode runs on a program that mimics itself as a real machine. This program is called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or Java Run-time Environment (JRE).
<br/>
This architecture makes Java bytecode runs on any machines that have JVM, independent of the OSs and CPUs. This means the effort in writing Java source code for a certain program is spent once and the target program can run on any platforms.
